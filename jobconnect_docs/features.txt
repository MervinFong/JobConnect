JobConnect System Feature Documentation (Detailed)

1. Resume Upload and Parsing
Users can upload their resumes in PDF or DOCX format. JobConnect uses PyMuPDF and python-docx to parse text content. Extracted data includes:
- Full name, contact info
- Work experience (company, title, dates)
- Skills, tools, and programming languages
- Education history
This data is stored securely in Firebase and used to improve job recommendations and recruiter searches.

2. Real-Time Job Recommendations
Using the extracted resume content, JobConnect compares the user profile with available job listings. It uses keyword matching and semantic similarity to suggest roles that match:
- Skills (e.g., “Python”, “SolidWorks”, “supply chain”)
- Job titles (e.g., “Data Analyst”, “Mechanical Engineer”)
- Industry relevance (e.g., tech, manufacturing)

3. MBTI Personality Test Integration
The system includes a 70-question MBTI test, modeled after the official framework. User types (e.g., ENTJ, INFP) are stored with timestamps. The assistant uses this data to:
- Recommend personality-aligned jobs
- Advise on strengths/weaknesses
- Track how user traits evolve over time

4. AI Chatbot Assistant (LangChain + OpenAI)
The chatbot uses LangChain’s `StuffDocumentsChain` + RetrievalQA. It retrieves documents from:
- Vector store (FAISS)
- User-specific Firebase records (MBTI, resume)
The response is generated using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo model trained on JobConnect logs.

5. Feedback and Fine-Tuning Pipeline
Each chat message allows “👍 Yes / 👎 No” feedback. These logs are saved per user and can be exported for:
- Analytics
- Chatbot retraining
- QA improvement
A fine-tuning JSONL is generated using real + synthetic data.

6. Recruiter Dashboard
Recruiters can:
- Post jobs
- View applicants
- Search resumes
Access is controlled using Streamlit + Firebase Auth. Roles are:
- recruiter
- candidate
- admin

7. Support Ticket System
Users can submit support tickets (e.g., bugs, help needed). Each ticket includes:
- Email
- Description
- Timestamp
- Admin response field
Admins view and respond through a dashboard interface.

8. Role-Based Streamlit Navigation
Based on user role in Firebase:
- Candidates see resume upload, MBTI test, job list
- Recruiters see job post tools and applicant tracking
- Admins see support tickets and logs

9. Personalized Resume Feedback
The chatbot reviews uploaded resume content and gives specific improvement suggestions (e.g., “Add more quantifiable achievements”, “Include a skills section”).

10. Job Save and Apply History
Users can:
- Save jobs for later
- Track applied jobs
- Prevent duplicate applications
All stored in Firestore with resume snapshots.

11. GPT Fine-Tuned Brain
Your assistant uses:
- `ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:personal::BS6z6ywt`
- Trained on JobConnect-specific question-answer pairs
- Combined with vector context + Firebase insights
This allows highly accurate, brand-specific guidance.
